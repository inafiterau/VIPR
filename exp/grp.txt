Each folder represents one set of data for classification.

Format of folder names: ‘task_source_dsetname’
- task is ‘grp’ for grouping
- source is artificial, auton, mobilize or uci, depending on where we obtained the data
- dsetname is the name of the dataset, with words separated by the ’-’ character

Each folder contains one or more tables, each containing data for a single classification talk. I have included both .csv and .mat files named files is ‘dsetname_tablename.csv’ and ‘dsetname_tablename.mat’, respectively.

The format of the files is described below:

1. .csv files
The table header contains feature names. 

2. .mat files
Features = Names of features (including output). The output is last.
X = Design matrix, representing values of the samples for each of the features. Rows are samples, columns are features.
